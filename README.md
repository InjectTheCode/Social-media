# Social-media
Express - MongoDB

. This project is about a simple and tiny social-media, which likes instagram with custom and less features.
. I'm tring to make this app with fully MVC architecture, I take care about how to write controllers, services, models and...
. For database I'm using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, which is a popular ODM for NoSQL database.
. I'm keen on to use RedisDB for refreshing token and for an interesting feature.
. This featur I've told you above, is similar instagram's story, I want to keep people's daily life style for 24 hours, 
  but I don't want to keep their stoy's photo right on the database. It has to gone and delete for ever after 24 hours.
. And finally, of course I'll keep update this app with new feature in the future.
